The price we pay - as a society, as a community, as a family and as human beings are enormous. The effect of violence covers generations and drains resources on all levels. Investing in preventing gender-based violence is therefore not only the right, but the wise thing to do.”\r\n\r\nBarrister Farzana Mahmood presented a comprehensive research paper evaluating Bangladesh’s existing legal framework regarding domestic violence and workplace sexual harassment during the roundtable. This paper, based on recent studies by the ILO, UNFPA, and UN Women, emphasised legal gaps and strengths, shedding light on necessary improvements.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAn alarming revelation was the prevalence of domestic violence in Bangladesh, with a 2015 survey indicating that approximately 72.6 per cent of married women have faced abuse.\r\n\r\nDespite the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act of 2010 aiming to address this, the Criminal Penal Code doesn’t classify domestic violence as a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nRecommendations stressed the criminalisation of domestic violence, police force training, and broader consultations with women’s rights organisations, academia, legal and social researchers, and the judiciary for law amendments.\r\n\r\nWhile the high court directive of 2009 provides guidelines to prevent sexual harassment in workplaces, educational institutions, and public places, laws like the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 still contain vaguely worded prohibitions needing revision such as “indecent or unmannerly of which is repugnant to the modesty or honour of any woman” requires immediate revision. \r\n\r\nFocusing on prevention, the chief guest, State Minister of Women and Children Affairs Fazilatun Nessa Indira, in her speech said, “We can reshape our culture. Changing men’s attitudes, stereotypical mindsets, and behaviour is essential to reduce violence against women.”\r\n\r\nAt the open discussion participants stressed the necessity of family-level interventions, assessing the cost of gender-based violence (GBV) and its impact on the national budget, addressing patriarchy, and investing in research to reduce violence against women and girls.\r\n\r\nCountry Representative of UN Women, Gitanjali Singh, highlighted, “Annual monitoring of laws and timely amendments are crucial to keep them relevant. The current global investments in preventing gender-based violence are not enough. Governments must unlock financing from various sectors and adjust national budgets through gender-responsive budgeting.”', '2023-12-17 16:29:54'),
